# Dragonmark - Util

A bunch of Clojure utility functions and packages

## License

Dragonmark is dual licensed under the Eclipse Public License,
just like Clojure, and the LGPL 2, your choice.

A side note about licenses... my goal with the license is to
make sure the code is usable in a very wide variety of projects.
Both the EPL and the LGPL have contribute-back clauses. This means
if you make a change to Dragonmark, you have to make your changes
public. But you can use Dragonmark in any project, open or closed.
Also, the dual license is meant to allow Dragonmark to be used in
GPL/AGPL projects... and there are some "issues" between the FSF
and the rest of the world about how open the EPL, the Apache 2, etc.
licenses are. I'm not getting caught in that deal.
